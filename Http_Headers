1.HTTP HEADERS

HTTP headers are key-value pairs sent in HTTP requests and responses. 
They provide essential information about the request or response, such as content type, authentication, caching policies, and more. 
Headers help the client and server communicate effectively.

2.DIFFERENT TYPES OF HTTP HEADERS

•	General Headers: Apply to both requests and responses (e.g., Date, Connection).
•	Request Headers: Provide information about the client or the resource being requested (e.g., User-Agent, Accept).
•	Response Headers: Provide information about the server or the response itself (e.g., Location, Server).
•	Entity Headers: Contain information about the body of the resource (e.g., Content-Type, Content-Length).

3.PURPOSE OF Content-Type HEADER

The Content-Type header indicates the media type of the resource being sent. 
It tells the client how to interpret the data in the body of the request or response. 
For example, Content-Type: application/json specifies that the data is in JSON format.

4.DIFFERENCE BETWEEN Cache-Control & Expires HEADERS

•	Cache-Control: 
Provides directives for caching mechanisms in both requests and responses. 
It allows for more granular control, such as no-cache, no-store, max-age, etc.
•	Expires: 
Specifies a date and time after which the response is considered stale. 
It is a simpler, older way of controlling caching. If both are present, Cache-Control takes precedence.

5.IMPORTANCE OF User-Agent HEADER
Answer:
The User-Agent header contains a string that identifies the client application (e.g., browser, library) making the request. 
It can include information about the software version and the operating system. 
This information helps servers tailor responses for different clients and track usage analytics.

6.WORKING OF Authorization HEADER

The Authorization header is used to provide credentials for authenticating a user agent with a server.
Common schemes include Basic (username and password encoded in Base64) and Bearer (used with OAuth tokens). 
This header helps secure APIs by ensuring that only authorized users can access certain resources.

7.USE OF Location HEADER

The Location header is typically used in HTTP responses to indicate the URL to which a client should redirect.
It is commonly used with 3xx status codes, such as 301 (Moved Permanently) or 302 (Found), to direct clients to a new resource location.

8.CORS & ITS RELATION WITH HTTP HEADERS

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a security feature that allows or restricts resources requested from another domain. 
It relies on specific HTTP headers, such as Access-Control-Allow-Origin, which tells the browser which origins are permitted to access the resource. 
This mechanism helps prevent cross-site scripting attacks.

9.Custom HTTP HEADERS

Custom HTTP headers are user-defined headers that allow clients and servers to send additional information not covered by standard headers.
They typically start with "X-", such as X-Custom-Header. However, the "X-" prefix is no longer recommended, and custom headers can be defined without it.

10. USE OF Accept HEADER

The Accept header specifies the media types that the client is willing to receive from the server. 
It can include multiple types with optional quality values (q-values) to indicate preferences. 
For example, Accept: text/html, application/json;q=0.9 tells the server to prioritize HTML but also accept JSON.
